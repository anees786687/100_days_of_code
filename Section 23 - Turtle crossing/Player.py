Player Module - Turtle Crossing Game

This module defines the Player class which represents the player-controlled turtle
in the crossing game. The player can move in four directions and has boundary
checking to prevent going off-screen.

Classes:
    Player: Inherits from turtle.Turtle, handles player movement and boundary detection
